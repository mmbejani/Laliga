# Laliga
Laliga is a new adaptive regularization scheme for deep neural networks. The details of this scheme was proposed in [1]. This implemention is on VGG family networks on CIFAR-10 datasets. As soon as possible, the other version of the proposed scheme on different datasets will be added. The implemention is based on Pytorch Framework with GPU.
