# Laliga
Laliga is a new adaptive regularization scheme for deep neural networks. The details of this scheme was proposed in [1]. This implemention is on VGG family networks on CIFAR-10 datasets. As soon as possible, the other version of the proposed scheme on different datasets will be added. The implemention is based on Pytorch Framework with GPU.

Some of the results on this scheme are proposed in the following figures:
